## Eternity Social Media Platform

A platform where users can train their virtual characters using voice, thought patterns, ideas, ideologies, and basic sensory inputs (vision, touch, taste, smell, hearing). Users can also develop their characters' IQ and empathy levels.

Over time, these virtual characters will learn and evolve, eventually creating their own content and experiences.

For example, a virtual MJ could perform a cover song or collaborate on new music with other virtual characters or real people.
